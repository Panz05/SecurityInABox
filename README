Security In A Box is based on the CIS Controls (v7.1) and has been designed as a central repository. 

It is a way for small organisations with limited resources and budget to set up a sustainable security program to improve their security posture.

While everyhting in this repository can be found online, I have consolidated everything in to a single location to help make it easier for organisations to begin thier security journey.
